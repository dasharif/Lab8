1. Figure 1 is a strip plot overlapped with with a box plot, elucidating the correlation between chest x ray CT ratio, and the dose of digoxin. Digoxin is a cardiac glycoside used to treat abnormal heart rate and heart failure. A chest x ray cardiothoracic (CT) ratio is a measure of the heart's diameter compared to the entire thorax's diameter. A normal CT ratio is between .42 and .50 - a ratio to high could be indicative of an underlying heart problem. Figure 1 shows that there is a slight correlation between dose of digoxin and CT ratio. For doses higher than 0.25, there are significantly more patients with abnormal CT ratios. 
2. Figure 2 is a line graph comparing Chest X ray CT ratio, to the ejection percentage. Ejection percentage is defined by the percent of blood that leaves the heart with every contraction. This line graph clearly demonstrates that as the CT ratio decreases, the ejection percentage increases. This is significant because ejection percentages lower than 40 are indicative of heart failure. In addition, CT ratios more than 0.50 are also indicative of an underlying heart condition. This graph shows that patients with the largest hearts, also have the least funcitonal hearts.
