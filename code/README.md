The code I used contains a combination of unix commands and python. 
To create the folders and files, I used unix commands and created 4 directories starting data, results, code, and figures. 
Before I started coding with python, I imported all the libraries I thought I would need in the future - pandas for dataframe work, seaborn for visualization, numpy for arrays, matplotlib for graphs using matplotlib axes commands and scipystats for statistics. 
I shrunk down the dataframe that I imported and saved it to startingData
I created two graphs, using seaborn and matplotlib and saved them to figures. 
I used the crosstab function to compare 2 columns and used a loop function to find the probability of each cell in the matrix. This matrix was saved in results
Next, I created a github public repository and added and committed all my code into it. 
Last, I created a ipynb file with all my code.
