First, all necessary folders and files were created. Then the Digoxin data frame was cleaned and reduced to only include columns of Interest, with the empty cells and incomplete rows removed. 
This reduced dataframe was saved into the folder startingData
Next, I graphed the connection between dose of digoxin with chest x ray CT ratio and saved it in the figures folder under the name DIGDOSEandCHESTXRAY
The next figure, called CHESTXRAYvsEJRPER was created - it is a line graph that compares the cardiothoracic ratio to the ejection percentage of each patient. This was also saved into the figures folder. 
Last, I created a probability matrix that shows the connection between worsening heart failure and death. This matrix was saved as a csv file into the folder "results"
